Title: Unistroke Gesture Recognizer

(CS 135 Assignment 4 Fall 2020)

I built a gesture recognizer in Racket that recognizes a type of gestures called unistroke gestures. The gestures that the recognizer recognizes are gestures that represent letters from the Graffiti alphabet. Gestures are created by a site created by the University of waterloo: https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~lank/canvas.html and is represented as a list of points.
